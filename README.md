# A list of my projects and just (home)works for 10th/11th grades in CS class
## Moscow state school №57 / programming-linguistics degree
На русском / read in Russian: [```README_ru.md```](https://github.com/leterDieu/schoolProjects/blob/main/README_ru.md).
The main programming language of out course is python.
### File organisation ans sctructure
There's currently a directory for only one (10th) grade, in which there's a direcotry for only one (1st) quarter of this grade. But regardless of grade and quarter the organisation of files remains the same.
For each quarter there's probably ```notebooks```, ```progs```, and ```projects``` directories, as well as a .md file with an explanation of a main topic of that quarter.
#### Notebooks
These are Jupiter notebooks (IPython). They are separeted to different directories by topics, but this topics often intersect each other, so it's important to look through each notebook in a quarter.
There's no .md files in this directory, because each notebook contains its tasks.
#### Progs
These are usually .py files, which separeted to different directories, a one directory being a separate task. Each of these directories contain a .md file with an explanation of the task.
#### Projects
There are a bunch of projects, each of which contain a .md with an explanation.
### Timings
I tend to upload new files and update .md ones (as well as some others) in a one week break I get between the quarters.
